# Docker
My path to learn Docker-Containers and later on Kubernetes.
I will save all of the stuff I am currently working on for Docker.
Hopefully it will help others as well:)


So this easieste way to create a container (the one I am currently using) is through Visual Code.
Simply create the directory on your local machine, open a VS Code window to the specific directory,
choose the image you want to use for your container and your are ready to go.

You can also install any dependecies through the terminal from VS Code or update etc. If the machine breaks down
you can simply create a new one:)
